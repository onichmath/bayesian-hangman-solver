# Bayesian Hangman Solver
This project implements a hangman solver, which computes the predictive probability of different letters given guess evidence in a hangman game. The solver uses a Bayesian approach to compute the likelihood of words and letters. The solver is implemented using Pandas for data storage and manipulation.
